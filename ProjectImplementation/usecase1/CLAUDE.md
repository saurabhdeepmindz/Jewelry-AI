# Jewelry AI — Usecase 1: Lead Automation Platform

**Usecase:** `usecase1` — Diamond & Jewelry Wholesale Lead Automation
**Type:** Python AI Platform (FastAPI + LangChain + LangGraph + Streamlit)
**Stack:** Python 3.11+, FastAPI, LangChain, LangGraph, PostgreSQL + pgvector, Redis, Celery, n8n, Streamlit
**Purpose:** Automates the full lead lifecycle for Shivam Jewels — from raw trade directory data to enriched, scored, and AI-outreached buyer relationships, with zero manual data entry.

> **Generic operating principles are defined in:**
> **[../../best-practices_rule_set_code/CLAUDE-GENERIC.md](../../best-practices_rule_set_code/CLAUDE-GENERIC.md)**
> Read that file first. This file adds usecase1-specific context on top of it.

STAGE 4: Design Patterns      ⬜ docs/design/
STAGE 5: Agile Planning       ⬜ agile/epics/ + agile/stories/
STAGE 6: Development          ⬜ src/
STAGE 7: Continuous Quality   ⬜ Throughout development
```

## Business Context (from Requirements)

### As-Is Process (Manual)
1. Collect raw company/buyer data from: GMTs, Jewelry Book of Trade, Hill Lists, Rapid Lists
2. Import and check if lead matches current diamond inventory (RBC, specific carat ranges)
3. If inventory match found → lead marked 'Eligible'
4. Manually search LinkedIn for key contacts (name, designation, email, phone)
5. Find physical/mailing address for postal outreach
6. Initiate outreach via email campaigns and/or phone calls
7. Manually log all contact details, outreach activity, and responses into CRM

### To-Be Process (Automated — this platform)
- Scheduled scraping from GMTs, Trade directories, Rapid APIs
- Auto inventory-match engine → Eligible / Not Eligible flag
- Contact enrichment via Apollo.io / Hunter.io / LinkedIn API
- Automated email + WhatsApp outreach sequences
- Auto-logging of all leads and responses to CRM
- Lead scoring based on match quality and past engagement

### After Automation
- 1 lead processed in minutes (vs hours manually)
- Standardized, enriched data every time
- Outreach within hours of lead identification
- CRM always up-to-date, zero manual entry

## Domain Entities

| Entity | Description | Key Relations |
|---|---|---|
| `Lead` | A jewelry buyer prospect (company) | Has contacts, matches, outreach messages |
| `Inventory` | A diamond/jewelry item in Shivam's stock | Matched to leads |
| `Contact` | Enriched buyer contact at a lead company | Belongs to lead |
| `OutreachMessage` | AI-generated email or WhatsApp message | Belongs to lead + contact |
| `CRMActivity` | Immutable audit event log entry | Belongs to lead |

---

## User Roles

| Role | Description | Key Permissions |
|---|---|---|
| `admin` | System administrator | Full platform access, config management |
| `manager` | Sales manager | View all leads, approve outreach, configure rules |
| `rep` | Sales representative | View assigned leads, manage own outreach |
| `system` | Automated processes | Pipeline execution, enrichment, CRM logging |

---

## Key Business Rules

- A lead is only eligible for outreach if it matches at least one available inventory item
- Outreach requires human review before sending (configurable via `HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED`)
- Enrichment API credits are finite — cache all results; never re-enrich an already-enriched lead
- CRM activity is append-only and immutable — never update or delete `crm_activity` rows
- Diamond carat weights follow GIA grading standards — always 2 decimal places
