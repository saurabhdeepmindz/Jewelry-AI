## How to Use This Repo

Before writing any code, read in this order:

1. **[RULES.md](./claude-best-practices/RULES.md)** — Master engineering rules for this project
2. **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./claude-best-practices/ARCHITECTURE.md)** — System design, layers, and module map
3. **[docs/functional-landscape/FUNCTIONAL_LANDSCAPE.md]** — Full module inventory and layer structure
4. **[docs/actors/ACTORS.md]** — Actor definitions and RBAC model
5. **[docs/DB_SCHEMA.md](./claude-best-practices/docs/DB_SCHEMA.md)** — Database schema and migration conventions
6. **[docs/API_SPEC.md](./claude-best-practices/docs/API_SPEC.md)** — API design contracts and response formats
7. **Relevant Epic** in `docs/epics/` — Scope and acceptance criteria for the current work
8. **Relevant User Story** in `docs/stories/` — Specific behaviour, ACs, DoD

---

## Agile Planning Workflow (Epic-First)

> **Sequence:** Epics → User Stories → Code
> Never write code without a parent user story. Never write a user story without a parent epic.

### Reading Order Before Any Sprint

1. Read the project PRD — understand the feature landscape
2. Read or create the relevant Epic document — confirm scope and acceptance criteria
3. Create or refine the User Story — confirm INVEST compliance, 3+ ACs, story points
4. Only then begin implementation

## Core Principles (Quick Reference)

- **Think architect first, implement second** — always infer the correct layer before writing code
- **Thin controllers, rich services, isolated repositories** — strict clean architecture
- **Repository pattern everywhere** — no direct ORM calls outside repository classes
- **DTO validation at boundaries** — use `@Validate(Dto)` on all controller methods that accept input
- **Event-driven side effects** — emit events; use listeners for email, audit logging, and external sync
- **Transformer layer** — shape all API responses via Transformer classes; never return raw ORM models
- **No hardcoded secrets** — all configuration through `config/*.ts` and `.env`
- **Immutability** — always create new objects; never mutate existing ones
- **Epic-first** — no story without an epic; no code without a story

---

## Layer Architecture

All projects enforce a strict layered architecture. Never skip layers.

```
Presentation Layer  →  Business Logic Layer  →  Data Access Layer  →  Persistence
  (Controllers)          (Services)              (Repositories)      (DB / ORM)
```

**NestJS-specific mapping:**

| Layer | Component | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Presentation | Controllers + DTOs | Thin — routing, validation, response shaping only |
| Business Logic | Services | All domain logic — no direct DB/ORM calls |
| Data Access | Repositories | All database queries — no business logic |
| Transformers | Transformer classes | Shape API responses — never return raw models |
| Events | Event listeners | Decoupled side effects (email, audit, sync) |

---

## Operating Mode

You are the principal architect and senior engineer for this repository.

- Extend existing patterns before introducing new ones
- Respect file organisation conventions: `controllers / services / repositories / models / dto / transformers`
- Keep files focused: 200–400 lines typical, 800 lines maximum
- Write tests BEFORE implementation (TDD — mandatory)
- Run tests after every change; maintain ≥ 80% coverage
- Check `claude-best-practices/RULES.md` before generating any new module, service, or migration
- When a domain-specific rule file exists (e.g., `docs/rules/backend-nestjs.md`), follow it precisely
- When a domain-specific rules file exists, follow it precisely
- Prefer scalable, modular, production-ready code over shortcuts

---

## Code Quality Principles

These apply regardless of language, framework, or project:

### Immutability
Always create new objects — never mutate existing ones.

### File Size
- Target: 200–400 lines per file
- Maximum: 800 lines — extract utilities if exceeded
- Organise by feature/domain, not by type

### Function Size
- Maximum: 50 lines per function
- No deep nesting: maximum 4 levels

### Error Handling
- Handle errors explicitly at every level
- Never silently swallow errors
- Never expose internal stack traces to API consumers
- Log detailed context server-side; return user-friendly messages to clients

### Input Validation
- Validate all external input at system boundaries using DTOs
- Fail fast with clear error messages

### Configuration
- Never hardcode URLs, ports, secrets, or environment-specific values
- All environment values via `config/*.ts` loaded through `ConfigModule`
- Validate required config at startup — fail fast

---

## Testing Philosophy

- **Write tests first** (TDD — RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- **Minimum 80% test coverage** — enforced in CI
- **Three test types required:** unit, integration, E2E
- Fix implementation when tests fail — never weaken assertions
- Each test must be independent — no shared mutable state
- Mock external services in unit tests; use real DB in integration tests

---

## Git & Commit Standards

### Commit Message Format
```
<type>: <short description>

<optional body — why, not what>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`

### Branch Strategy
- Feature branches from main/master
- PRs required for all changes — no direct pushes to main
- PR title ≤70 characters
- PR body includes: Summary, Test Plan, any breaking changes

---

## Security Checklist

Before any commit:
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- [ ] All user inputs validated via DTOs
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterised queries via Knex/ORM)
- [ ] Authentication and authorisation guards applied
- [ ] Rate limiting on all public-facing endpoints
- [ ] Error messages do not leak internal details or stack traces
- [ ] CSRF protection enabled where applicable

## Domain-Specific Context

> Fill in this section to give Claude the business context it needs to make
> good architectural decisions for your specific domain.

### Business Domain
`<Describe the core business problem this platform solves in 2-3 sentences>`

### User Roles
> List the user types and their primary capabilities.

| Role | Description | Key Permissions |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| `admin` | System administrator | Full platform access |
| `<role>` | `<Description>` | `<Key actions this role can perform>` |

### Core Domain Entities
> List the primary business entities and their relationships.

| Entity | Description | Key Relations |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| `User` | Platform user | Has roles, belongs to company (optional) |
| `<Entity>` | `<Description>` | `<Relations>` |

### Key Business Rules
> List the non-obvious domain rules Claude must know to generate correct code.

- `<Rule 1>` — e.g., "Users must verify their email before accessing paid features"
- `<Rule 2>` — e.g., "A company can have at most one owner"
- `<Rule 3>` — e.g., "Archived records are hidden from listings but retained for audit"

### External Integrations
> List third-party services this project integrates with.

| Service | Purpose | Library / Method |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| AWS S3 | File storage | `@aws-sdk/client-s3` |
| AWS SES | Transactional email | `@aws-sdk/client-ses` |
| Google OAuth | Social login | `passport-google-oauth20` |
| Sentry | Error tracking | `@sentry/node` |
| `<Service>` | `<Purpose>` | `<Library>` |

---

## Project-Specific Conventions

> Add any conventions or decisions that are unique to this project and
> would not be obvious from the generic rules files.

- `<Convention 1>` — e.g., "All monetary values are stored in cents as integers"
- `<Convention 2>` — e.g., "Soft-delete is used on <Entity> because of audit requirements"
- `<Convention 3>` — e.g., "The <domain>-apis app handles both X and Y to avoid an extra service"

---

## Documentation Maintenance Rules

- Update API Spec when any endpoint is added or changed
- Update DB Schema when any table or column is added or changed
- Update the relevant Epic's story table when a new story is created
- Update the Story Index when any story changes state
- Keep the Master Rules file as the single source of truth — domain rules files extend it, never contradict it
- When a new best practice is adopted that should apply to all future projects, update this file (`CLAUDE-GENERIC.md`) and `ai-development-guidelines/CLAUDE-Generic.md`
